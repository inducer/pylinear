\chapter{Matrix-Free Methods}
\label{cha:matrixfree}

\begin{quote}
   This chapter introduces the notion of an \class{Operator}, which
   is PyLinear's way of expressing matrix-free methods.

\section{The \class{Operator} concept}

\begin{classdesc*}{Operator}
  An \class{Operator}\index{Operator} is a (typically linear) mapping
  of one vector to another. A matrix is a particularly prominent
  example of this, but \class{Operator}s are mainly used to represent
  vector-to-vector mappings for which no matrix is available (or too
  expensive to compute explicitly).
  \footnote{
    Note, however, that for technical reasons \class{Matrix} classes are
    not automatically \class{Operator} instances--they need to be
    explicitly made into these, as we will see soon.
  }
\end{classdesc*}

Given this single purpose, an \class{Operator} has a pretty 
simple interface:
\begin{memberdesc}[Operator]{shape}
  Returns a tuple \code{(h,w)}, which, in analogy to a \class{Matrix},
  specifies the sizes of the vectors received and returned by the
  \class{Operator}.
\end{memberdesc}
\begin{methoddesc}[Operator]{typecode}{}
  Returns the typecode (see \ref{sec:types-and-flavors}) of the
  \class{Vector}s that this \class{Operator} operates on. This is also
  the typecode of the \class{Vector}s returned by the operations of this
  \class{Operator}. For technical reasons, the two always match.
\end{methoddesc}
\begin{methoddesc}[Operator]{apply}{before, after}
  This method operates on the \class{Vector} \code{before} and returns
  the result of the operation in \code{after}. \code{after}
  needs to be a properly-sized \class{Vector}. Its initial values
  typically do not matter, but may be used as starting guesses,
  for example by iterative solvers. Initializing after to
  all zeroes is always acceptable.
\end{methoddesc}

\section{\class{Operator}s Form an Algebra}

On top of this simple interface of an \class{Operator}, PyLinear 
provides a layer of convenience functions that facilitate the
creation of derived instances, among other things.

\opindex{()}For an \class{Operator} \code{A}, saying \code{A(x)}
with a properly sized and typed \class{Vector} \code{x} will
return the result of applying \code{A} to \code{x}, via the

\opindex{+}For two \class{Operator}s \code{A} and \code{B}, you may write
\code{A+B} to obtain an \class{Operator} mapping that will
perform the operation \code{A(x)+B(x)}. The operator \code{-} works
in an analogous fashion.

\opindex{*}For two \class{Operator}s \code{A} and \code{B}, you may
write \code{A*B} to obtain an \class{Operator} mapping that will
perform the composed operation \code{A(B(x))}. You may also say
\code{a*B} or {B*a} with an \class{Operator} \code{B} and a scalar
\code{a}, and will obtain an \class{Operator} that performs
\code{a*B(x)}. A unary minus \code{-A} returns the negated
operator.

\section{Types of \class{Operator}s}

Matrix-generated are the most obvious kind of \class{Operator}, but 
there are more--and they do not necessarily correspond to a stored
matrix representation.

All the ways to generate \class{Operator} instances are contained 
in the \module{pylinear.operation}. Let's import it:
\begin{verbatim}
  >>> from pylinear.array import *
  >>> import pylinear.operation as op
\end{verbatim}

Each type of operator comes with a constructor class. For example,
matrix operators are constructed by calling the method \method{make}
on the object called \var{MatrixOperator} in the \module{operation} 
module. Consider this example:
\begin{verbatim}
  >>> a = array([[1,2],[3,4]])
  >>> a_op = op.MatrixOperator.make(a)
  >>> v = array([5,6])
  >>> a*v
  >>> a_op(v)
  >>> a_plus_a_op = a_op+a_op
  >>> a_plus_a_op(v)
  >>> four_a_op = 2*a_op + a_plus_a_op
  >>> four_a_op(v)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{classdesc*}{MatrixOperator}
  A \class{MatrixOperator} makes a matrix into an \class{Operator}.
\end{classdesc*}
\begin{methoddesc}{make}{matrix}
  This static method takes a matrix argument and returns a matrix
  operator of the corresponding type.

  It does not make a copy of the matrix, instead, it just keeps
  a reference to the given matrix around.
\end{methoddesc}

Now that you have seen one constructor class, you have basically
seen them all, as they are basically structured in the same way.
What is going to vary from here on down is
\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the constructor class and
\item the arguments of the \method{make} call.
\end{itemize}

So, let's dive right in.
\begin{classdesc*}{CGOperator}
  A \class{CGOperator} inverts an \class{Operator} given to it
  by means of the Hestenes/Stiefel Conjugate Gradient method.

  It requires that the matrix representation of the given 
  \class{Operator} be symmetric.
\end{classdesc*}
