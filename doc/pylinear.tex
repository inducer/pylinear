\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  PyLinear provides a comprehensive and extensible environment for 
  linear algebra in Python.

  It is comprehensive in that it offers sparse and dense matrices
  of real and complex types, along with a full set of operations
  on them.

  It is extensible in that it can trivially be programmed in Python, but it may
  just as trivially be extended in C++. If \texttt{mex} programming in Matlab
  always sounded too cumbersome, PyLinear provides a refreshing new (and easy)
  perspective. This allows a new type of hybrid numerical system, where
  non-performance-critical parts may remain in the high-level language, while
  inner loops may be easily moved to C++.

  There is no shortage of Python packages that provide matrices and operations
  on them. Numerical Python, numarray and the new NumPy (formerly SciPy Core)
  are good examples.  However, few of these packages focus exclusively on
  Linear Algebra, and even fewer provide crucial tools for numerical analysis,
  such as sparse matrices. PyLinear fills this niche.
