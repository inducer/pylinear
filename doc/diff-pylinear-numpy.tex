\chapter{Differences to NumPy and numarray}
\label{cha:diff-pylinear-numpy}

\begin{quote}
   This chapter outlines the differences between PyLinear and the packages
   Numerical Python and numarray.

Unlike NumPy, PyLinear does \emph{not} allow more than two or less
than one index dimension, i.e. it only suports objects with one and
two indices, also known as vectors and matrices. In fact, even vectors
and matrices are different types internally, while NumPy glosses over
these differences and makes them all a single \emph{array type}. This
makes sense since NumPy's focus is on array-shaped data, such as
images and measurements, while PyLinear's focus is on linear algebra.
