\section{Checking prerequisites}

The first step in installing TagPy is to make sure that you have the
right software installed on your computer. You will need the
following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \citetitle[http://www.python.org]{Python} is of course
    the most important prerequisite. Version 2.3 or newer will work.
  \item The \citetitle[http://boost.org]{Boost libraries}. 
    Versions 1.33 and up work fine. Section \ref{sec:install-bpl}
    will help you with the installation of this prerequisite.
  \item The
    \citetitle[http://news.tiker.net/software/boost-bindings]{Boost
    UBlas library bindings}. Section \ref{sec:install-bindings} will
    help you with this.
  \item A good enough C++ compiler. \citetitle[http://gcc.gnu.org]{gcc}
    version 3.3 and up work fine.
\end{itemize}

Optionally, you may install the following libraries to augment
PyLinear's functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \citetitle[http://netlib.org/blas]{Basic Linear
    Algebra Subprograms}, better known as the BLAS. This will
    not enable any new functionality by itself, but is a
    prerequisite for the following libraries.
  \item The \citetitle[http://netlib.org/lapack]{Linear Algebra
    Package}, better known as LAPACK. This will enable a few
    extra operations on dense matrices, such as finding eigenvalues,
    the singular value decomposition or the inverse.
  \item \citetitle[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/]{UMFPACK},
    which requires BLAS, will provide an efficient direct solver
    for linear systems involving sparse matrices.
  \item \citetitle[http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/]{ARPACK},
    which requires both BLAS and LAPACK, allows the solving of
    sparse eigenvalue problems.

    If you are planning on using ARPACK, please also read about the
    this \citetitle[http://news.tiker.net/node/373]{bug} that might
    require you to patch ARPACK in order to use PyLinear with ARPACK.
    (If you don't use it, you may get invalid results or inexplicable
    crashes. Do yourself the favor.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Installing Boost Python}

\label{sec:install-bpl}

Installing the Boost libraries in a way that is suitable for PyLinear
is, unfortunately, a non-straightforward process, at least if you are
doing it for the first time. This section describes that process.

There is a bit of good news, though: If you are lucky enough to be
using the Debian flavor of Linux or one of its derivatives, you may
simply type \code{aptitude install libboost-python-dev} and ignore the
rest of this section.

Otherwise, you must follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Download a Boost release.
  \item Download and install Boost.Jam, a build tool.
  \item Build Boost, such as by typing
    \begin{verbatim}
      bjam -sPYTHON_ROOT=/usr -sPYTHON_VERSION=2.4 -sBUILD="release <runtime-link>dynamic <threading>multi"
    \end{verbatim}

    (You may have to adapt \code{PYTHON_ROOT} and
    \code{PYTHON_VERSION} depending on your system.)
  \item Check the directory 
    \begin{verbatim}
      boost/bin/boost/libs/python/build/libboost_python.so/gcc/release/shared-linkable-true/threading-multi
    \end{verbatim}
    and find \file{libboost_python*.so}. Copy these files to somewhere
    on your dynamic linker path, for example:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \file{/usr/lib}
    \item a directory on \envvar{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    \item or something mentioned in \file{/etc/ld.so.conf}.
    \end{itemize}
    You should also create a symbolic link called \file{libboost_python.so}
    to the main \file{.so} file.

  \item Run \program{ldconfig}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Installing the Boost UBlas Bindings}

\label{sec:install-bindings}
This part is, fortunately, very easy. Just go to \url{http://news.tiker.net/software/boost-bindings},
download the current snapshot and extract it somewhere, for example by typing
\begin{verbatim}
  tar xvfz boost-bindings-NNNNNNNN.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
Then remember the path where you unpacked it for the next step.

\section{Installing PyLinear}

As a first step, copy the file \file{siteconf-template.py} to
\file{siteconf.py} and open an editor on that file. You will
see a bunch of variables that you may customize to adapt
PyLinear to your system. First of all, there are a few variables
that are named \var{HAVE_XXX}, such as \var{HAVE_BLAS}. They
all default to \code{False}. If you have the corresponding library
available, set that variable to \code{True}.

For each library that you have answered \code{True} above, you may
need to state in which directories to find the header files (in
\var{XXX_INCLUDE_DIRS}), the libraries (in \var{XXX_LIBRARY_DIRS})
and finally, if the libraries are named in some nonstandard fashion,
you may also have to change the library names to link against (in
\var{XXX_LIBRARIES}). The defaults work at least with Debian Linux. 

These above instructions apply to all prerequisite libraries. Here are
a few hints for specific libraries:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Boost, set \var{BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR} to the directory where
  the root of your boost tree.  Typically, it ends in
  \file{boost}. For \var{BOOST_LIBRARY_DIRS}, give the path where you
  put the \code{libboost_python*.so} files. Finally, you should
  usually leave BPL_LIBRARIES unchanged and make a symbolic link from
  \file{libboost_python.so} to the actual (non-symlink) \file{.so}
  file.
\item For the Boost bindings, just insert the path where you unpacked
  them--No further installation is required.
\item Here's an extra trick for BLAS and LAPACK if you are using
  Debian: If you install lapack and blas, make sure to install the
  versions ending in ``3'' (i.e. \code{blas3-dev} and
  \code{atlas3-dev}), and also install ``\code{atlas3-ARCH}-dev'',
  where \code{ARCH} is your processor architecture. Debian will then
  automatically activate an accelerated BLAS for your computer.
\end{itemize}

Then, type
\begin{verbatim}
  python setup.py build
\end{verbatim}
and wait what happens. This will compile PyLinear, which, depending on
your compiler, will take around 400 MB of your computers memory. If you
do not have this much physical memory, this might be quite slow due to
swapping. Once this step completes, type
\begin{verbatim}
  su -c "python setup.py install"
\end{verbatim}

As a final step, you may change into the \file{test/} subdirectory
and execute
\begin{verbatim}
  python test_matrices.py
\end{verbatim}
This will execute PyLinear's unit test suite. A few failures here
are ok, since the matrices for which we perform computations are
randomly generated. If you run the tests multiple times, there
should however be no tests that fail consistently every time.

Congratulations! You have now successfully installed PyLinear.
