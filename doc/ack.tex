PyLinear owes much to the heroes who fleshed out Numerical Python,
numarray and their corresponding interfaces. In particular, large
parts of this manual are shamelessly borrowed from numarray.

PyLinear was written as part of a Diplom thesis at the Institut für
Angewandte Mathematik at Universität Karlsruhe (TH), Germany. I am
grateful that my advisor, Prof. Dr. Willy Dörfler, gave me the freedom
to choose to write my own matrix package as part of my thesis. The
package was significantly enhanced and released to the public during a
paid research stay at his institute, whose support I gratefully
acknowledge.

PyLinear has also benefitted from discussions I had with Roman Geus of
the Paul Scherrer Institute in early stages of the project.

Last, but not least, PyLinear would not even exist if it weren't for
Python and the Boost C++ libraries.
