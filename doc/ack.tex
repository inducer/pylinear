PyLinear owes much to the heroes who fleshed out Numerical Python, numarray,
numpy and their corresponding interfaces. In particular, some parts of this
manual are shamelessly borrowed from numarray, as are a few docstrings.

PyLinear was written as part of a Diplom thesis at the Institut für Angewandte
Mathematik at Universität Karlsruhe (TH), Germany. I am grateful that my
advisor, Prof. Dr. Willy Dörfler, gave me the freedom to choose to write my own
matrix package as part of my thesis. The package was significantly enhanced and
released to the public during a paid research stay at his institute, whose
support I gratefully acknowledge.

PyLinear has also benefitted from discussions I had with Roman Geus of the Paul
Scherrer Institute in early stages of the project.

Last, but not least, PyLinear would not even exist if it weren't for Python and
the Boost C++ libraries.
